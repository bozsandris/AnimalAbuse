# AnimalAbuse
AnimalAbuse is a project made by me for my BSC thesis.
This mobile application helps you to report cases of animal abuse/inadequate animal keeping (like to an organization) by taking photos, giving some detail and showing your location.
The filled report is then uploaded to a server and is stored as a document in a MongoDB database.
